<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>WHAT IS AMBITION?</small></h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Ambition is the spur that makes man struggle with
destiny: it is heaven&#8217;s own incentive to make purpose
great, and achievement greater.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a factory where mariners&#8217; compasses are
made, the needles, before they are magnetized,
will lie in any position, wherever they are
placed, but from the moment they have been
touched by the mighty magnet and have been
electrified, they are never again the same.
They have taken on a mysterious power and
are new creatures. Before they are magnetized,
they do not answer the call of the North
Star, the magnetic pole does not have any effect
upon them, but the moment they have been
magnetized they swing to the magnetic north,
and are ever after loyal and true to their affinity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Multitudes of people, like an unmagnetized
needle, lie motionless, unresponsive to any
stimulus until they are touched by that mysterious
force we call ambition.</p>

<p>Whence comes this overmastering impulse
which pushes human beings on, each to his individual
goal? Where is the source of ambition,
and how and when does it gain entrance
into our lives?</p>

<p>How few of us ever stop to think what ambition
really means, its cause, or significance!
Yet, if we could explain just what ambition is,
we could explain the mystery of the universe.
The instinctive impulse to keep pushing on
and up is the most curious and the most interesting
thing in human life. It exists in
every normal human being, and is just as pronounced
and as real as the instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p>I believe this incessant inward prompting,
call it ambition or what we will, this something
which pushes men to their goal, is the expression
in man of the universal force of evolution
which is flowing Godward, that it is a part
of the great cosmic plan of creation. We do
not create this urge, we do not manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
it. Every normal person feels this imperious
must which is back of the flesh, but not of it,
this internal urge which is ever pushing us on,
even at the cost of our discomfort and sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is a part of every atom, for all atoms are
alive, and this upward impulse is in every one
of them. It is in the instinct of the bee, the
ant, and in all forms of insect and animal life.</p>

<p>The same kind of urge that is in the seed
buried out of sight and which is ever pushing
it up and out through the soil, prodding it to
develop itself to the utmost and to give its
beauty and fragrance to the world, is in each
one of us. It is ever pushing us, urging us
on to fuller and completer expression, to a
larger, more beautiful life.</p>

<p>But for this desire to get on and get up,
this God-urge, everything, even the universe
itself, would collapse. Inertia would bring
everything to a standstill.</p>

<p>If we obey this call we expand, blossom into
beauty and develop into fruitage, but if we
neglect or dissipate it, if we only half obey
it, we remain mere scrub plants, without flower
or fruitage.</p>

<p>That mysterious urge within us never allows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
us to rest but is always prodding us for our
good, because there is no limit to human
growth there is no satisfying human ambition&mdash;man&#8217;s
higher aspiration. When we
reach the height which looks so attractive
from below, we find our new position as unsatisfying
as the old, and a perpetual call to
go higher still rings in our ears. A divine
impulse constantly urges us to reach our highest
ideal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith and the ideal still remain the most
powerful levers of progress and of happiness,&#8221;
says Jean Finot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of a man who had striven
all his life faithfully and singly toward an object,&#8221;
asked Thoreau, &#8220;and in no measure obtained
it? If a man constantly aspires, is he
not elevated? Did ever a man try heroism,
magnanimity, truth, sincerity, and find that
there was no advantage in them,&mdash;that it was
a vain endeavor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aspiration finally becomes inspiration and
ennobles the whole life.</p>

<p>When the general habit of always aspiring,
moving upwards and climbing to something
higher and better is formed, all the undesirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
qualities and the vicious habits will fade
away; they will die from lack of nourishment.
Only those things grow in our nature which
are fed. The quickest way to kill them is to
cut off their nourishment.</p>

<p>The craving for something higher and better
is the best possible antidote or remedy for the
lower tendencies which one wishes to get rid
of.</p>

<p>Every faintest aspiration that springs up in
our heart is a heavenly seed within us which
will grow and develop into rich beauty if only
it be fed, encouraged. The better things do
not grow either in material or mental soil without
care and nourishment. Only weeds,
briers, and noxious plants thrive easily.</p>

<p>Most young people seem to think that ambition
is a quality that is born in one and which
cannot be materially changed, but the greatest
ambition may be very materially injured in
many different ways. The habit of procrastination,
of postponing, the habit of picking
out the easier tasks and putting off the difficult
ones, for example, will very seriously impair
the ambition. Whatever affects the ideals affects
the ambition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Ambition often begins very early to knock
for recognition. If we do not heed its voice,
if it gets no encouragement after appealing to
us for years, it gradually ceases to trouble us,
because, like any other unused quality or
function, it deteriorates or disappears when unused.</p>

<p>God is whispering into the ear of all existence,
of every created thing &#8220;Look up.&#8221;
Every sentient thing in the universe seems to
be trying to get to a higher level. Everything
is in the process of evolution, and the evolution
is always upward. The butterfly does not become
a grub. It is not the evolutionary law.
The grub develops into a butterfly. It is
never the other way.</p>

<p>Be careful how you discourage or refuse to
heed that inner voice which commands you to
go forward, for if you do it will become less
and less insistent until finally it will cease to
prod you, and when ambition is dead deterioration
has set in.</p>

<p>That inner call to go forward, to push on to
a higher good, is God&#8217;s voice; heed it. It is
your best friend and will lead you into light
and joy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE SATISFIED MAN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">F. W. Robertson</span> has said, &#8220;Whoever is
satisfied with what he does has reached his
culminating point&mdash;he will progress no more.
Man&#8217;s destiny is to be not dissatisfied, but forever
unsatisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the saddest things in life is to see
men and women who started out with high
hopes and proud ambitions settle down in mediocre
positions, half satisfied just merely to get
a living, to plod along indifferently.</p>

<p>Oh, what tragedy there is in being content
with mediocrity, in getting into a state where
one is indifferent to the larger, better things
of life!</p>

<p>When you are satisfied with the life you are
living, with the work you are doing, with the
thought you are thinking, with the dreams you
are dreaming, satisfied with the character you
are building, with your ideals, you may be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that you are already beginning to deteriorate.</p>

<p>There is little hope for the man who feels
satisfied with himself, who does not know, &#8220;the
noble discontent that stirs the acorn to become
an oak.&#8221; Man&#8217;s ambition to improve
something somewhere every day to get a little
further on and a little higher up than he was
the day before, an insatiable passion for bettering
things all along the line, is the secret of
human progress.</p>

<p>Do you realize, my young friend, that if the
motive were big enough, if you had a very unusual
incentive, you could materially improve
upon what you now are satisfied to consider
your best endeavor? As an employee you
may think you are doing your level best, and
are conscientious, loyal, true and industrious;
and yet, if a great prize should be offered you
to bring your work up to a certain higher
standard for the next sixty days, would you
rest until you had succeeded in very greatly
improving what you now think is your best
work?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you think, you who pride yourself
that it would be impossible to better what you
are now doing, that if your name were over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the door as proprietor instead of the name of
the company you work for you could jack
yourself up about fifty per cent; that you
would find some way of doing it? Don&#8217;t you
think you would be a little more ambitious,
make a little better use of your time, that you
would try to call out a little more ingenuity
and effectiveness, a little more resourcefulness?
Do you think you would jog along in
the same half-hearted manner, thinking more
of your salary than of your opportunity to absorb
the secrets of your employer&#8217;s success?
Do you think you would stand by without protest
and see the merchandise injured, or
wasted, when you could stop it; or that you
would be so careless or make so many blunders
yourself? Don&#8217;t you think the prize to be
gained would make you take a little more interest
in things than you do now; make you a
little more alert, more eager for the success
of the business?</p>

<p>It is a deplorable sight to see so many young
men and young women apparently so satisfied
with themselves, with what they are doing,
that they have no great yearnings, no insatiable
longing for something higher and better.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Multitudes of capable employees are satisfied
to plod along in mediocrity instead of rising
to the heights, where their ability would
naturally carry them. I have a friend who
has a much superior brain to the man he is
working for, and yet for a great many years
he has been on an ordinary salary. He has
never married. He takes life in an easy-going
way and whenever I have tried to encourage
him to go into business for himself, to show him
how much superior he is to the man he is working
for, he always says, &#8220;Why should I exert
myself more or take on greater business, responsibilities?
I have nobody but myself to
consider. I like to have a good time, and don&#8217;t
want to have the worry, the care and anxiety of
running a business of my own, although I
know perfectly well I could do it if I wanted
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, the higher up in the world a man
gets the greater his responsibility, but think of
the satisfaction which comes from the consciousness
that he has made the most of his
talents, that he has not buried any of them in
a napkin, the satisfaction which comes from
the feeling that he has made good, that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
delivered his message to the world and delivered
it like a man, that he has fulfilled his mission,
that he has made the most possible of the
material and the opportunities given him.
The feeling that he has no regrets, that he has
done his level best more than compensates for
any additional effort and greater responsibility.</p>

<p>We tend to become like our aspirations. If
we constantly aspire and strive for something
better and higher and nobler, we cannot help
broadening and improving. The ambition
that is dominant in the mind tends to work
itself out in the life. If this ambition is
sordid and low and animal, we shall develop
these qualities, for our lives follow our
ideals.</p>

<p>Civilization has made its greatest advancement
under the stress of necessity, under the
leadership of a great ambition to satisfy the
heart&#8217;s yearnings for better things. We do
our best work while we are trying desperately
to match our dreams with their reality.</p>

<p>The struggle of man to rise a little higher,
to get into a little more comfortable position,
to secure a little better education, a little better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
home, to gain a little more culture and refinement,
to possess that power which comes from
being in a position of broader and wider influence
through the acquirement of property, is
what has developed the character and the
stamina of our highest types of manhood to-day.
This upward life-trend gives others confidence
in us.</p>

<p>When we have attained a little success, when
we have gained a little public applause, how
many of us think we can relax our efforts, and
before we realize it our ambition has disappeared,
our energy evaporated. A sort of
lethargy comes over us and lulls us into inaction.</p>

<p>First successes, and especially early successes,
to many act like an opiate. They are
overcome with inertia which only an unsatisfied
and determined ambition can overcome. It
takes more grit and a stronger will to force
ourselves to do our level best after we have
demonstrated without doubt that we have the
ability to do what we undertake, than it does
to achieve the actual first success itself.</p>

<p>One of the greatest enemies to ambition is
personal inertia, and it is one of the hardest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
things to overcome. The temptation to slide
along the line of the least resistance, to get into
a comfortable position and take one&#8217;s ease, is
so strong that many allow it to master them.
The ambition is not persistent enough or strenuous
enough to shame them out of their inertia,
or prod them on to greater things. Mediocrity
is often a premium upon laziness. The
poet tells us,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He who would climb the heights sublime,</div>
<div class="indent">Or breathe the purer air of life,</div>
<div class="verse">Must not expect to rest in ease,</div>
<div class="indent">But brace himself for toil or strife.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most discouraging problems in
the world is that of trying to help the ambitionless,
the half-satisfied, those who have not discontent
enough in their natures to push them
on, initiative enough to begin things, and persistency
enough to keep going.</p>

<p>If a young man is apparently satisfied to
drift along in a humdrum way, half content
with his accomplishments, undisturbed by the
fact that he has used but a very small part of
himself, a very small percentage of his real
ability, that his energies are running to waste
in all sorts of ways, you cannot do much with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
him. If he lacks ambition, life, energy and
vigor&mdash;is willing to slide along the line of the
least resistance and exerts himself as little as
possible, there is nothing upon which to build.</p>

<p>It is the young man who is not satisfied with
what he does, and who is determined to better
his best every day, who struggles to express
the ideal, to make the possible in him a reality,
that wins.</p>

<p>Activity is the law of growth; effort the only
means of improvement. Whenever men have
obeyed their lower nature and ceased to
struggle to better their condition, they have
deteriorated physically, mentally and morally;
while, just in proportion as they have striven
honestly and insistently to improve their situation,
they have developed a larger and nobler
human type.</p>

<p>When a man who is said to be the highest
salaried official in the United States was asked
to give the secret of his success, he replied, &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t succeeded. No real man ever succeeds.
There is always a larger goal ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the small man who succeeds in his own
estimation. Really great men never reach
their goal, because they are constantly pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
their horizon out further and further, getting
a broader vision, a larger outlook, and
their ambition grows with their achievement.</p>

<p>If you are getting a fair salary in a mediocre
position there is danger of hypnotizing
yourself into the belief that there is no need to
exert yourself very much to get up higher.
There is danger of limiting your ambition so
that you will be half content to remain a perpetual
clerk when you have the ability to do
much better.</p>

<p>This satisfaction with the lesser when the
greater is possible often results from relatives
or friends telling you that you are doing well,
and that you would better let well enough
alone. These advisers say: &#8220;Don&#8217;t take
chances with a certainty. It is true you are
not getting a very big salary, but it is a sure
thing, and if you give it up with the hope of
something better you may do worse.&#8221; Don&#8217;t
let any one or any conditions make you think
you have not the ability to match your longings.
Wrapped up in every human being
there are energies which, if unfolded, concentrated,
and given proper attention will develop
his highest ideal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Our longings are creative principles, prophecies,
indicative of potencies equal to the task
of actual achievement. These latent potencies
are not given to mock us. There are no
sealed orders wrapped within the brain without
the accompanying ability to execute them.</p>

<p>When you once get a glimpse of yourself as
you were intended by your Maker to be, with
all of your latent possibilities developed into
realities; when you once see yourself as the
superb man it is possible for you to be, nothing
and no one but yourself can prevent you
from attaining your ambition.</p>

<p>It is only the man who has stopped growing
that feels satisfied with his achievements. The
growing man feels a great lack of wholeness,
of completeness. Everything in him seems to
be unfinished because it is growing. The expanding
man is always dissatisfied with his accomplishment,
is always reaching out for something
larger, fuller, completer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Environment</span> has a great deal to do with
man&#8217;s ambition and achievement. It may
make all the difference to you, my friend, between
success and mediocrity, whether you are
in a favorable environment and keep close to
people who inspire and encourage you, who
communicate to you the enthusiasm of their
example, or whether you are surrounded by
discordant conditions, and associate with people
who have an opposite effect upon you.</p>

<p>We cannot associate with a really ambitious
person without catching his spirit to a greater
or less extent. We unconsciously reflect the
people with whom we mingle much. Their
mark is left upon us. We may not be able
to see it ourselves, but other people can detect
it.</p>

<p>Our Indian schools sometimes publish, side
by side, photographs of the Indian youths as
they come from the reservation and as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
look when they are graduated&mdash;well dressed,
intelligent, with the fire of ambition in their
eyes. We predict great things for them; but
the majority of those who go back to their
tribes after struggling awhile to keep up their
new standard gradually drop back to their old
manner of living. There are, of course, many
notable exceptions, but these are unusually
strong characters, able to resist the downward-dragging
tendencies about them.</p>

<p>If you interview the great army of failures,
you will find that multitudes in it have failed
because they never got into a stimulating, encouraging
environment, because their ambition
was never aroused, or because they were not
strong enough to rally under depressing, discouraging,
or vicious surroundings.</p>

<p>How often we see men and women with
splendid brain power, with robust physiqúe,
apparently superbly equipped for great careers,
and yet they are living very ordinary
lives, plodding along perhaps in mediocrity!
This may be because they have never been
aroused, and are totally ignorant of their powers.
They may never have looked into the
mirror of others who were succeeding along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their lines and caught a glimpse of their own
possibilities.</p>

<p>Whatever you do in life, make any sacrifice
necessary to keep in an ambition-arousing atmosphere,
an environment that will stimulate
you to self-development. Keep close to
people who understand you, who believe in
you, who will help you to discover yourself
and encourage you to make the most of your
life. Choose companions and friends who are
in sympathy with your ambition and who will
give you their moral support and make you
do what you are capable of doing. A few
such friends may make all the difference to
you between a grand success and a mediocre
existence. We are all diamonds in the rough.
Our environment may grind one, two or
twenty facets. Some people never come in
contact with the wheel which grinds a facet and
lets in the light to reveal the hidden wonders.
Many are buried as rough diamonds even
though there may have been locked up in them
great brilliancy and enormous value. Comparatively
few human diamonds are ever so
completely ground that all the hidden treasures
are revealed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Yet how trifling are the things which sometimes
reveal the man! It may be the sight of
a motto, the hearing of a sermon, a speech, the
reading of some inspiring life history or some
stirring ambition-arousing book, the encouraging
conversation of a friend, of some one who
believes in us and sees in us something which
we never knew was there.</p>

<p>I know men who had apparently lost their
ambition, who had been literally down and out,
but who, by the reading of an inspiring book,
or listening to a stimulating sermon, were thoroughly
aroused to their possibilities even in a
most discouraging environment and so completely
transformed in a few months that they
did not seem like the same individuals.</p>

<p>The speeches of Wendell Phillips, Webster,
and Henry Clay, started a fire in many an ambitious
youth which never went out, but which
became a beacon light in American history.</p>

<p>We all know that the old-fashioned debating
societies and clubs woke up the ambition of
many a youth in the early days of our country,
who might never have been heard from outside
of his own little community but for the
arousing influence of these debates.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>The ambition of the boy who has lived on a
farm in the back country is often aroused for
the first time when he goes to the city. To
him the metropolis is a colossal world&#8217;s fair,
where everybody&#8217;s achievement is on exhibition.
The progressive spirit which pervades
the city is like an electric shock to him and
arouses all of his latent energies, calls out his
reserves. Everything he sees seems to be a
summons to him to go forward, to push on.</p>

<p>He is constantly reminded by his city environment
of what others have done. He sees
the tremendous engineering feats, great factories
and offices, vast businesses, all huge advertisers
of man&#8217;s achievement, and is stirred
by an ambition to do something great himself.</p>

<p>Ambition is contagious. When a man
meets others at the restaurant or club, or in
other social ways, and hears accounts of their
great successes, greater achievement, he immediately
says to himself, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I do it?&#8221;
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I do it?&#8221; and if he is of any account
he probably says, &#8220;I <i>will</i> do it!&#8221; Then
he goes back to his business with a new determination,
perhaps with new ideas and new
conceptions of the possibilities of his own success.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>I have known young business men in the
country who have not been specially successful
who got tremendous impetus to their ambition
by visiting larger city concerns in the same
line of business. The greater successes
touched their pride and they went back home
and began to brace up and build up.</p>

<p>The same thing is true in professional life.
The young country doctor visits a city hospital,
attends clinics, sees operations by noted
surgeons, and he goes home with his ambition
fired and makes a vigorous resolution to try
harder to be somebody in his own profession.</p>

<p>Men who are in business in small towns
where they have no competition, and where
they very seldom come in contact with those
who are successful in their line of trade, are in
constant danger of getting into a rut. Their
ambition unconsciously becomes dulled, the
energy oozes out of their efforts, and they take
things easier, jog along in the same old manner
year after year, and before they realize it
dry rot gets into their business.</p>

<p>It is much easier to keep up one&#8217;s interest
and enthusiasm to do things worth while when
we are right in touch with the ambitious, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
those who are forging ahead with all their
might, and who are perhaps working under
great difficulties.</p>

<p>One of the unfortunate things about small
towns and country places is the lack of stimulus
to ambition. Many people living in remote
country districts do not come in contact
with standards by which they can measure and
compare their own powers. They live a quiet
uneventful life, and there is little in their environment
to arouse the faculties which are not
active in their vocation.</p>

<p>If you are ambitious to get on you will learn
some splendid lessons from studying the qualities
of those who have succeeded along the line
of your ambition. You will find that it is a
characteristic of the winner, that he is always
thinking upon his life theme, is always headed
towards the goal of his ambition, always planning
along the line of his dreams. He talks
the things, acts in the same direction, his whole
life is absorbed in his theme. He radiates law,
medicine, engineering, or manufacturing. By
keeping his mind in a positive, creative condition
he is constantly encouraging his mental
magnet to attract the thing he is studying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
If he is studying law he thinks law, pictures
himself pleading at court, or giving advice in
his office. He becomes a law magnet to attract
law.</p>

<p>I know a man who says he will not take
chances of the demoralization and the deterioration
which would be worked in his nature
by associating with habitual failures. He
will have nothing to do with such people.
He avoids doing business with them, for he
says he finds that no matter how he may protest
against it, he is unconsciously influenced
by them.</p>

<p>There is no denying that there is much truth
in this. We are unconsciously affected by the
atmosphere surrounding us. Like attracts
like. Successful people attract successful
people. Failure attracts failure. Unlucky
people attract unlucky people. Slovenly,
slipshod people attract others of the same sort.
&#8220;Birds of a feather flock together.&#8221; The failures
get together; the successes come together
naturally.</p>

<p>On every hand we see young men who
started out with brilliant prospects when they
left college. Their friends predicted great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
things for them, but somehow or other, the enthusiasm
of their school or college days soon
oozed out. The continual suggestion of possibility
which came to them from their school
environment, the contagion from the ambitious
spirit all about them, seemed then to multiply
their prospects, to magnify their ability and
to stir up their ambition until they really
thought they were going to amount to something
in the world, were going to accomplish
something; but after they got away from the
battery-charging institutions, they gradually
lost their enthusiasm; their ambition dwindled.
Their ideals changed with their environment.
Little by little their dreams faded, and they
resigned themselves to mediocrity or hopeless
failure.</p>

<p>There is no environment so unfavorable, so
discouraging, no situation so disheartening
that a youth who is made of the right kind of
material cannot change it. Lincoln, Benjamin
Franklin, Fred Douglas, John Wanamaker,
Marshall Field and thousands of other
American boys found themselves in the midst
of the most disheartening environment but
made a new environment for themselves. It
is possible for you to do the same.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The great trouble with most of us is that we
never get aroused, never discover ourselves until
late in life,&mdash;often too late to make much
out of the remnant that is left. It is very important
that we become aroused to our possibilities
when young, thus we may overcome
the most unfavorable environment and get the
greatest possible efficiency out of our lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>UNWORTHY AMBITIONS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are scores of people in our great
cities who do not really live at all. They
merely exist. They are the slaves of a morbid
ambition and a greed that has grown to be a
monster. Many of these people take very little
comfort; they are always on a strain to keep
up appearances, to maintain homes in portions
of the city where they can ill afford to live, to
keep automobiles when they can barely afford
a bicycle, to wear clothing and jewelry which
is beyond their means, and they keep themselves
constantly worried over it, killing their
legitimate comfort and enjoyment through the
exhaustion of the strain and stress,&mdash;and all
for nothing that is real or permanent, nothing
that adds to their character or well being.</p>

<p>Such people have a perfect mania for trying
to make other people think they are better
off than they really are, that they amount to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
more than they really do, that they cut a bigger
figure in the world than is actually the case.
In other words, they make themselves pitiable
slaves of other people&#8217;s eyes. They go
through life not doing the things they ought
to do, what is best for their welfare and
growth. Their lives are superficial because
they do not live in or deal in realities. Everything
about them is deceiving. They live
masked lives. Few people know them as they
really are. They only know them as they pretend
to be. What do these people, who are
always chasing shadows, get out of life, anyway?</p>

<p>There is an ambition which reminds one of
a bird whose voracious appetite can never be
satisfied. It grows on what it feeds, and the
more it eats, the more ravenous the appetite.
Woe be it to him who caters to a false ambition!
He follows it blindly, expects that it
will give him peace when it is satisfied, but
alas, it is never satisfied. It is like the water
in the enchanted story: the more the victim
drank of it, the greater was his burning thirst.
Such an ambition is fatal, and will surely
wreck him who blindly pursues it. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ruin his health and will rob him of all that is
dearest and sweetest in life.</p>

<p>There are a great many people in this country
who are committing suicide upon many
years of their lives by being slaves of an inordinate
ambition.</p>

<p>One of the most pathetic phases of our civilization
is that men and women in poor health,
devitalized from over-work, are goaded on way
beyond their strength by a fiendish ambition.
Their pride and their vanity say to them,
&#8220;Now, it will not do to slow down. We must
keep up the pace with our neighbors. People
who do not keep up appearances in these days
are nobodies. We must keep going, no matter
how we feel. We must make more money,
we must show more evidence of our prosperity.
We must put up a better front or Mrs. Grundy
will pass the suspicion along that we are, after
all, not much of a success, that we lacked the
ability to do what people thought we were going
to do. No matter how we feel we must
keep up, keep pushing, keep going, crowd on
more steam, take stimulants and drugs, if
necessary, goad ourselves on. It is absolutely
imperative to keep pushing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Oh, what fools pride and vanity make of us,
especially when we are in no condition to keep
up the pace, when we owe it to ourselves to
slow down, when it is positively wicked to
crowd on more steam! How many people are
driven into the grave by the lash of a mortgage
on a farm, on a home, or on their business, put
there in an attempt to satisfy some over-vaunting
ambition!</p>

<p>Debt has made more people miserable,
ruined the peace of mind of more human beings,
the comfort and the happiness of more
homes, than almost anything else in the universe.
It is a terrible thing to so mortgage
oneself to others that we must make slaves of
ourselves. How much better to live simply,
to struggle on in poverty until we can improve
our position than to compromise ourselves with
debt, sell ourselves to a mortgage, or a bill of
goods!</p>

<p>What an easy thing it is to borrow money, to
give a note or to give a mortgage! We believe
at the time that we can pay all right, but
no one can be certain that things will go all
right with him. No one knows what the times
may bring forth. No one knows whether his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
health and strength will be spared, or how soon
he may be physically or mentally disabled.</p>

<p>The only true measure of real success is the
quality of the ambition. If the animal figures
too largely in your ambition, if the quality is
coarse, the success will be cheap, no matter
how great the quantity.</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate thing that so many of
our youth should start out in life with only
one aim; and that is to make money. This
becomes the leading purpose in their lives and
warps their way of looking at things. Everything
else is seen in dwarfed proportions.
They do not consider making a life, building
character; they are bent only on making
money. This is the all-absorbing topic everywhere.</p>

<p>The goal we hold in the mind is the model
which shapes our lives, and its character is reflected
in everything we do. Think, therefore,
what the influence must be of pointing all our
faculties, focusing all of our energies upon the
money-making goal! How it must warp and
twist and wrench out of their natural orbit the
more delicate sentiments, the finer faculties.
When everything in us looks moneyward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the gaze is held persistently upon the dollar
and what it will bring, what must be the havoc,
the tragedy, the fatal damage in the affections,
the friendships, and the social faculties!
When the affections are chilled and the friendships
strangled what is there left in a man but
the monster, brute qualities?</p>

<p>This is why a youth who starts out with
noble aspirations, with fine sensibilities and responsive
affections, often becomes hardened in
his business career. His finer sensibilities and
more delicate faculties atrophy from disuse,
because he overdevelops the grasping, greedy,
selfish faculties by the modern mania for the
almighty dollar.</p>

<p>The transformation is so insidious that he
does not half realize it until he finds himself
stooping to scheming and plotting and underhand
cunning, which would have shocked him
a few years earlier.</p>

<p>When a man once gets in the power of the
selfish, greedy, grasping monster within him,
which he has fed and catered to so long that
it has become a giant, it is almost impossible
to wrench himself away, and he often becomes
the slave of the very thing he once despised
and loathed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>It is always a question of what is uppermost
in the ambition, the dominant aim, that shapes
the life most. When a man has pursued an
aim for years which tends to dry up the best
within him, when he has used all of his life
forces, all of his energies, to feed that unworthy
ambition until it has become a monster
which controls him, he is a pitiable creature.
There is no more distressing sight in the world
than that of one who is completely in the
clutches of a heartless, grasping, greed.
Spurred on by the morbid ambition which has
taken possession of him, he is madly pursuing
the dollar which haunts him, until he is deaf
to all appeals of his finer self, and has lost all
taste for that which he once enjoyed.</p>

<p>Multitudes of people seem to think that if
they were only in an ideal environment, where
they would be free from worry or anxiety regarding
the living-getting problem, if they
were free from pain and in vigorous health,
they would be perfectly happy. As a matter
of fact, we are not half so dependent for happiness
upon our environment, or upon circumstances,
as we sometimes imagine we are.
False ambition, envy and jealousy are responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for much of our uneasiness, our restlessness
and discontent. Our minds are so intent
upon what other people have and are doing
that we do not get a tithe of the enjoyment and
satisfaction out of our own work, out of our
own possessions, that they should afford us.</p>

<p>An inordinate ambition, a desire to get
ahead of others, a mania to keep up appearances
at all hazards, whether we can afford it
or not, all these things feed selfishness, that
corrosive acid which eats away our possible enjoyment
and destroys the very sources of happiness.
The devouring ambition to get ahead
of others in money making, to outshine others
socially, develops a sordid, grasping disposition
which is the bane of happiness. No man
with greed developed big within him need expect
to be happy. Neither contentment, satisfaction,
serenity, affection, nor any other member
of the happiness family can exist in the
presence of greed, or an inordinate, selfish ambition.</p>

<p>We have had some conspicuous examples of
political aspirants who have put their personal
ambition above their duty to their party and
their country. Time and again one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
other of the great political parties has been
well-nigh ruined by a man who could put
his own personal ambition against even his
country&#8217;s welfare.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous thing to put personal ambition
above duty, anyway, but especially so to
a politician or statesman, who is rendered
doubly dangerous if he possesses great magnetic
qualities.</p>

<p>We do not always know where the following
of ambition&#8217;s call will lead us, but we do know
this, that by being loyal to ambition and doing
our best to follow it in its normal, wholesome
state, when not perverted by selfishness, by
love of ease or self-gratification, it will lead to
our best and highest welfare, that when we
follow, when we put ourselves in a position to
give it the best and the freest scope, it will
lead us to the highest self-expression of
which we are capable, and will give us the
greatest satisfaction. We know, too, that
when our ambition is perverted to base ends
our lives go all awry; when we are false to the
higher voice within us, we are discontented,
unhappy, inefficient, and our lives are ineffective.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>When a man becomes so infatuated with the
mania for wealth, position, fame or notoriety
that he focuses his whole soul, all his powers
and energies, upon a false ideal,&mdash;upon a selfish,
narrow goal, he develops only a very small
part of himself and he becomes very narrow.
He lives most who lives truest. He lives most
who touches life in the largest number of the
largest and highest points.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t start out in life with a false standard;
a truly great man makes official position and
money and houses and estates look so mean
and poor that we feel like sinking out of sight
with our cheap laurels and our ill-earned gold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>AMBITION KNOWS NO AGE LIMIT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> has become of that something which
in your youth keyed your determination up to
such a lofty pitch? What has become of that
something in you which would not let you rest,
which robbed you of sleep, which constantly
prodded you, bombarded you with visions of
the great and wonderful things you were going
to do in the future?</p>

<p>One of the earmarks of old age is the cooling
down of the fires of ambition. While they
burn brightly, as long as you feel just as eager
and as determined as in your younger days
to do your level best, to get up and to get on
in the world, to keep growing, to keep improving,
you are not aging very much. Your years
may dispute this, but as long as a man aspires,
as long as he is eager to grow, as long as he
yearns and struggles to better his best he is
not old.</p>

<p>When we are getting along in years there is
always a great temptation to make ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
believe that we have a right to let up a bit and
to take things easier, to get rid of as much
drudgery as possible. We have less and less
inclination for the strenuous struggle to attain
that which characterized our youth. The
great danger at this time is that as we let up a
bit in our efforts our ambition will decline, all
of our life standards drop.</p>

<p>Many people are not quite as painstaking,
not quite as particular when they get along in
years as in their younger days. It is so much
easier then to slide along easily, not to trouble
about one&#8217;s dress and personal appearance, to
hypnotize oneself into thinking, &#8220;Well, it does
not matter very much now, I am no longer
young.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things one is called
upon to do as the years pass is to keep his ambition
from dying, his ideals clear and clean-cut,
his interest in his work from getting stale.</p>

<p>The secret of keeping the ambition fresh and
bright is in keeping up the interest. The
artist who is in love with his work, no matter
how old, never loses his zest, his enthusiasm.
He goes to his canvas in old age with all the
interest and eagerness of his youth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Many men and women age through sheer
laziness, mental inertia, indifference. They
are only half alive. They are not willing to
take the trouble to pay the price for perpetual
youth, to keep their ambition from lagging.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that the ambition
to do a certain thing in life is a permanent
quality which will remain with them. It is
not. One of the first symptoms of age and
deterioration in one&#8217;s work is the gradual, unconscious
oozing out, shrinkage, of one&#8217;s ambition.
There is no one quality in our lives
that requires more careful watching and constant
bracing up, jacking up, so to speak, than
our ambition, especially when we are advancing
in years, and do not keep in an atmosphere
which tends to arouse one to life&#8217;s possibilities.
Without realizing it, or meaning to, we then
easily become victims of the human inclination
to take things easy, not to exert oneself very
much.</p>

<p>No matter how high our youthful ambition,
it is very easy to let it wane with the years, to
allow our standards to drop. The moment we
cease to brace ourselves up, to watch ourselves,
we begin to deteriorate, just as a child does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
when his mother ceases to pay strict attention
to him and lets him have his own way. The
tendency of the majority at every age of existence
is to go along the line of least resistance,
to take the easiest way. The race instinct
to climb is continually at war with the
lower nature which would drag it down.
Even the noblest beings are not free from the
struggle of the higher with the lower which
goes on ceaselessly throughout nature. It is
the triumph over the lower that keeps the race
on the ascent.</p>

<p>There is no more pitiable sight in the world
than that of a person in whom ambition is
dead,&mdash;a man who has repeatedly denied that
inward voice which bids him up and on, a man
in whom ambition&#8217;s fires have gone out from
the lack of fuel. There is always hope for a
person, no matter how bad he may be, as long
as his ambition is alive; but when that has disappeared,
the great life-spur, the impelling
motive is gone.</p>

<p>It requires a great deal and a great variety
of food to keep the ambition vigorous. Unless
it is well fortified it does not amount to
anything. It must be backed by a robust will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
power, stern resolve, physical energy, and great
powers of endurance, to be effective.</p>

<p>The habit of watching the ambition constantly
and keeping it alive, is absolutely imperative
to those who would keep from deteriorating.
Everything depends on the ambition.</p>

<p>If we lived and thought more scientifically
there would not be such a dropping of standards,
such a dulling of ideals, and letting down
in our efforts with advancing years.</p>

<p>Whatever our ambition may be, nothing else
can be quite so precious to most of us as life,
and we want that life at its best. Every normal
person dreads to see the mark of old age,
the symptoms of decrepitude, and wants to remain
fresh, buoyant, robust, as long as possible.
Yet most people do not take sensible
precautions to preserve their youth and vigor.
They violate the health laws, longevity laws;
sap their vitality in foolish, unnatural living,
in deteriorating habits.</p>

<p>I have a friend who is always referring to
his age. He has formed a habit of constantly
dwelling upon his declining years, and keeping
the picture of decrepitude in his mind. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
know, when a man gets past sixty he can&#8217;t
stand what he once could,&#8221; he will say.</p>

<p>The idea that our energies and forces must
begin to decline and the fires of ambition die
out after a certain age is reached has a most
pernicious influence upon the mind. We do
not realize how impossible it is for us to go
beyond our self-placed &#8220;dead-line&#8221; limits, to
do what we really believe we cannot do.</p>

<p>No one is old until the interest in life is gone
out of him, until his spirit becomes aged, until
his heart becomes cold and unresponsive; as
long as he touches life at many points he can
not grow old in spirit. A man is old, no matter
what his years, when he is out of touch
with youth, with its ideals, its points of view,
out of touch with the spirit of his times; when
he has ceased to be progressive and up-to-date.</p>

<p>Many of the grandest characters that ever
lived have retained their youthful mentality up
to the very last of a long life. There was no
deterioration in the mind of Marshall Field.
When in his advanced years he never showed
any inclination to take less pains, any cooling
of ambition, any inclination to bank his fires,
to drop his standards, to lower his ideals. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
know that Gladstone&#8217;s mind was right in its
prime at eighty.</p>

<p>Many a man signs his death warrant when
he retires from business. Retiring from business
to many means practically retiring from
life, that is, from real living, because they have
nothing to retire to. They have not prepared
themselves for retirement to anything outside
of routine business life. They have lost most
of their friends in their absorption in business
and their exclusive mode of living. They
have never developed their social faculties,
their love of art, of music, or of reading. The
whole life has gone into one business channel
and when out of this they are lost.</p>

<p>Life means little without a purpose. Once
his life aim is gone man simply exists&mdash;he does
not really live. A high ideal, a lofty purpose,
a noble aim, whatever tends to make man look
up and struggle up, tends to improve his
health condition and prolong the life. The
soul that aspires, other things being equal, has
the longest life. Aspiration is a perpetual
tonic; it stimulates all the faculties.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>MAKE YOUR LIFE COUNT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Everywhere</span> we see men and women doing
the lower, the commoner things, seemingly
satisfied to do them all their lives, when they
have the ability to do the higher.</p>

<p>Many people do not start out with ambition
enough to spur them to do big things. They
make a large career practically impossible at
the very outset, because they expect so little
of themselves. They have a narrow, stingy
view of life and of themselves which limits their
ambition to a little, rutty, poverty-stricken
groove.</p>

<p>If I could give the American youth but one
word of advice, it would be that which Michael
Angelo wrote under a diminutive figure on a
canvas in Raphael&#8217;s studio, when he called and
found the great artist out, &#8220;Amplius,&#8221; meaning
&#8220;larger.&#8221; Raphael needed no more. This
word meant volumes to him. I advise every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
youth to frame this motto, hang it, up in his
room, in his store, in his office, in the factory
where he works, where it will stare him in the
face. Constant contemplation of it will make
his life broader and deeper.</p>

<p>A fine ambition is a splendid life steadier.
It holds us to our task; keeps us from yielding
to the hundred temptations that might ruin
us.</p>

<p>What chaos there would be but for man&#8217;s
ambition to get up and get on in the world and
to improve his condition.</p>

<p>Nothing so strengthens the mind and enlarges
the horizon of manhood as a constant
effort to measure up to a worthy ambition. It
stretches the thought, as it were, to a larger
measure, and touches the life to finer issues.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am determined to make my life count,&#8221;
said a poor young immigrant with whom I was
talking not long ago. Now, there is a resolution
that is worth while, because it is backed
by a high ambition, the determined purpose to
be a man, to make his life one of service to
humanity.</p>

<p>This young fellow works hard during the
day, studying in a night school, and improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
himself in every possible way in his odds and
ends of time.</p>

<p>This is the sort of dead-in-earnestness that
wins. This is the sort of material that has
made America distinctive among all the nations
of the earth. This is the sort of determination
that gave us a Lincoln, an Andrew
Jackson, an Edison, a John Muir&mdash;all our
great men, native born or adopted sons.</p>

<p>Could any one have a nobler ambition than
this&mdash;to make his life count? One cannot
imagine its failure, backed up by dead-in-earnestness.</p>

<p>The quality of the ambitions of a people at
any time locates them in the scale of civilization.
The ideals of an individual or a nation
measure the actual condition and the future
possibilities and probabilities.</p>

<p>The trouble with many youths is they start
out with no definite plan, no one unwavering
aim, for success, no worth while goal in view.
They just look for a job. It may fit them or
it may not, and they plod along, doing their
work indifferently, with no spirit or ambition
to push them towards the heights.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how many people there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>who have no definite aim or ambition, but just
exist from one day to another with no well-defined
life plan. Although the great world
war has done much to bring our youth to a
realization of their responsibilities and raised
their ideals to a lofty height we still see all
about us on the ocean of life young men and
women aimlessly drifting without rudder or
port, throwing away time, without serious purpose
or method in anything they do. They
simply drift with the tide. If you ask one of
them what he is going to do, what his ambition
is, he will tell you he does not exactly know
yet what he will do. He is simply waiting for
a chance to take up something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between the great things that we cannot
do and the small things we will not do, the
danger is that we shall do nothing,&#8221; says
Adolphe Monod.</p>

<p>It is not enough for success to have ability,
education, health. Hundreds of thousands
have all these and still fail, or live in mediocrity,
because they do not put themselves in
an attitude or condition for achievement.
Their ability is placed at a disadvantage by
the lack of a big motive, the stimulus of a
worthy ambition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;The important things in life is to have a
great aim and to possess the aptitude and perseverance
to attain it,&#8221; says Goethe.</p>

<p>Of course, many people are hindered in the
race through no fault of their own, but the vast
majority of those who cease to climb and give
up (often right in sight of their goal), do so
from some weakness or defect. Many of them
lack continuity of purpose or persistency; others
lack courage or determination. Many of
these unfortunates would attain to at least
something of real success by merely sticking
to their tasks.</p>

<p>If the motive is big enough the ability to
match it is usually forthcoming. There is not
one of you, my friends, who could not be more
alert, more original, more ingenious, more resourceful,
more careful, more thorough, more
level-headed; not one of you who could not use
a little better judgment a little more forethought,
a little more discrimination, if you
saw a tempting prize ahead of you as a reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever may be your ambition, play fair
with yourself. Quit the side issues.&#8221; Cut out
the diversions. Live with and for your big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ambition. Drop all else to attain your end
and you will win&mdash;you will be and you will
have what you want.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a lesson in pruning and lop off the
useless branches which consume vitality and
obscure the sunshine.&#8221; That card club that interferes
with early rising; that light reading
that takes your mind off preparation for bigger
things, and all other wasteful habits.
Have you cut them off? If you have not it is
because you don&#8217;t want the &#8220;big thing&#8221; hard
enough to deserve it, and you won&#8217;t get it unless
you prune off the useless habits that are
diverting your energy and keeping you away
from the main chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Success in life is a process of selection and
elimination&mdash;a choosing between the worthless
and the worth while. To get time for things
that count you must save time by eliminating
all else. Copy the athlete at the training
table, feed on that which builds you up and
keeps you fit for the struggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unless you are inspired by a great purpose,
a resolute determination to make your life
count, you will not make much of an impression
upon the world about you. The difference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the quantity and quality of success is largely
one of ambition and determination. If you
lack these you must cultivate them vigorously,
persistently, or you will be a nobody. I have
never known any one to make a place for himself
in the world, who did not keep his purpose
alive by the constant struggle to reach his
goal. The moment ambition sags, we lose the
force that propels us; and once our propelling
power is gone we drift with the tide of circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;The youth who does not look up will look
down, and the spirit that does not soar is destined
to grovel.&#8221;</p>

<p>A young stenographer said to me once that
if she felt sure she had the ability to become an
expert literary stenographer, she would go to
evening school and would study nights and
holidays, and improve herself in every possible
way; but if she was convinced that she could
never attain very great speed, she would simply
prepare herself for ordinary letter dictation,
and let it go at that.</p>

<p>She did not seem to think that making the
most possible of what ability she had would
give her a correspondingly good position, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that the best possible training she could give
herself would be the best possible investment
she could make, and would give her infinite
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The less ability you have, my young friend,
the more important it is that you make the
most possible out of it. If you are obliged to
get your living, and, some of you, to support
a family and make a home with one talent, you
certainly need to make the most possible out
of it, and to put forth much greater effort than
if you had been given ten talents.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>VISUALIZE YOURSELF IN A BETTER POSITION</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> matter in what business you may be, or
what your profession, your prime ambition
should be to attain a high-water mark in it.
The love of excellence is the lodestar that leads
the world onward. It is this that makes not
only the successful business or professional
man, but also the all-round successful person in
any line of endeavor.</p>

<p>Andrew Carnegie said, &#8220;I would not give a
fig for the young man in business who does not
already see himself a partner, or the head of
the firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not rest for a moment in your thought
of yourself as a head clerk, foreman, or manager
in any concern, no matter how big it is.
Say each day to yourself, &#8220;My place is higher
up.&#8221; Be king in your dreams. Vow that
you will reach the position with untarnished
reputation, and make no other vow to distract
your attention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>I am frequently asked by youths and young
men whether I think they really have enough
in them to make much of a success in life, anything
that will be distinctive or worth while,
and I answer, &#8220;Yes, you have. I know you
have the ability to succeed, but I don&#8217;t know
that you will. That rests entirely with you.
If you have the energy and the will to succeed
nothing can hold you back. But if you have
not, no amount of education, no pull or influence,
no power on earth outside of yourself can
push or lead or boost you into success.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is nothing so important in your life
as your mental attitude towards yourself, what
you think of yourself, the model which you
hold of yourself and your possibilities. If this
is small, narrow, and dwarfed your life will correspond.</p>

<p>You must see yourself above a clerkship or
you will never be anything higher than a clerk.
You must visualize yourself in a better position,
and hold constantly a grim determination
to reach it or you will never get there. Never
for a moment blur your motive or weaken your
determination by harboring a doubt of your
ability to reach your goal. Whenever you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this you are neutralizing just so much of the
force which would take you there.</p>

<p>Remember, there is a partnership waiting
for you somewhere if you are big enough and
determined enough and have pluck enough to
take it. If you do not there is probably someone
very near you who will do so, someone
who perhaps has not had nearly as good an opportunity
as you have had. And in the years
to come, if you do not take advantage of this
opportunity to climb, you will no doubt,
grumble at your &#8220;ill luck&#8221; and wonder how
Billy or Johnny or Jo, who worked alongside
of you, managed to get the partnership or
coveted position.</p>

<p>A recent writer says: &#8220;My advice to all those
just starting to travel life&#8217;s turnpike is:
&#8216;Don&#8217;t start until you have your ideal. Then
don&#8217;t stop until you get it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Very few of us realize how dependent our
growth is on some special stimulus. Every act
must have a motive. We do nothing outside
of our automatic habitual acts without an underlying
motive. Perhaps the stronger life
motive of the average man is that which comes
from his desire to get up in the world.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_fp054.jpg" alt="LINCOLN STUDYING BY THE FIRELIGHT" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="gap"><small>Copyright, 1900, by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.</small></span></p>

<p class="caption">LINCOLN STUDYING BY THE FIRELIGHT.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>There was a force behind Lincoln which
drove him from a log cabin up to the White
House. There was a vision of the North Pole
which haunted Peary, filled him with ambition
to climb to the earth&#8217;s uttermost boundary, and
finally drove him, after repeated failures, to
the Pole. The same indomitable inner force
urged the despised young Jew, Benjamin Disraeli,
to push his way up through the lower
classes in England, up through the middle
classes, up through the upper classes, until he
stood a master, self-poised, upon the topmost
round of political and social power, the prime
minister of the greatest country in the world.</p>

<p>The story of those men is the same at bottom
as that of every man who has attained greatness.
They were continually urged forward
and upward by some inward prompting they
could not resist.</p>

<p>This instinctive impulse to keep pushing on
and up is the most curious and the most interesting
thing in human life. It exists in
every normal human being, and is just as pronounced
and as real as the instinct of self-preservation.
Upon this climbing instinct
rests the destiny of the race. Without it men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would still be savages, and living in caves and
huts. Civilization, as we know it, would not
exist. There would be no great cities, no great
factories, no railroads, no steamships, no beautiful
homes or parks, pictures, sculpture or
books, but for this mysterious urge which we
call ambition.</p>

<p>The best of every man&#8217;s work is above and
beyond himself, and is accomplished in the
struggle to attain a lofty ideal. The artist
stands aside and points through his work to a
glimpse of the universal art. In his inspired
moments the individuality of the orator is
melted and fused into the all-pervading fire of
eloquence. In art or business, in science or
the daily commonplace tasks of life, the gods
will move along toward the line of absolute
excellence or they will leave us to our own devices.</p>

<p>We do our most effective work in our struggle
to get what we are after, to arrive at the
goal of our ambition. We put forth our greatest
effort, our most strenuous endeavor, while
we are climbing, not after we have arrived at
our goal. This is one reason why rich men&#8217;s
sons rarely achieve any great personal success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
They lack the climbing motive of necessity,
that tremendous urge, the prodding of ambition
which drives us on to achieve what we desire
and are capable of attaining. Ambition
is the leader of all great achievement. It is
the forerunner which goes ahead and clears
a way for the other faculties.</p>

<p>The ambition is not always a safe guide,
however. There are two wings to genius.
Common sense and good judgment must accompany
the ambition, or it will very often
run away with a man. We have seen splendid
pieces of machinery, whose iron fingers would
punch holes through solid steel plates without
a single jar. The machinery accomplishes
this wonderful feat because of a huge balance-wheel.
It is the stored-up power, velocity,
and momentum which enable it to accomplish
this wonderful task. Take away the balance-wheel,
and the machinery, which does its work
as easily as a cook would make the holes in
rolled-out pastry, falls all to pieces the moment
the balance-wheel is removed. The balance-wheel
is the secret. The judgment is
man&#8217;s balance-wheel&mdash;great common sense,
horse sense. His ambition will run away with
him if he does not have this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>The young man who overestimates his ability,
who plunges beyond his depth, who is over-confident,
whose self-trust is not based upon an
accurate knowledge of his ability and limitations,
almost always comes to grief. It is just
as necessary to know what you are not qualified
for, and to let it alone, as to know what
you can do, and do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Study yourself,&#8221; says Longfellow, &#8220;and
most of all, note well wherein kind nature
meant you to excel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It takes a giant to do a giant&#8217;s work. What
a Morgan or a Carnegie would do with perfect
ease and safety, might be as impossible for you
to accomplish as to lift yourself by your own
boot straps. On the other hand, you may be
able to do something which even a Morgan
could not do. Study your own adaptations.
Try to get a measure of your possibilities.</p>

<p>A man should early take an inventory of his
ability and locate himself where he belongs.
If he has but one talent he should not try to
train with the ten-talent man. He should
simply try to make the most of his one talent.</p>

<p>It is impossible to make one talent do the
work of ten talents, no matter how ambitious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
or how much energy one may fling into his
work.</p>

<p>A great brain does a great thing easily.
We all do our best work without overstraining.
It is dangerous to over-tax one&#8217;s faculties.</p>

<p>I have seen a college student who has overstrained
his brain until he has seriously marred
his mental power in the foolish effort to try to
head his class when he was not a natural
scholar. He seemed to think that by making
a superhuman effort, studying all the time
when others were at play, during holidays and
Sundays, always plugging, plugging, plugging,&mdash;he
could overcome any handicap.
While he managed to come pretty near leading
his class he never completely rallied from the
effects of overstraining his brain.</p>

<p>It is a great thing to be able to measure our
talents, to understand ourselves so thoroughly
that we will undertake just so much as we are
able to accomplish, and will not aim at the unattainable.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THWARTED AMBITION</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> about us we see people who seem to
have no special zest in life, no great enthusiasm
for anything; there is a great disappointment
somewhere in their lives. Why are they so
unhappy?</p>

<p>No one loses his interest in life, or becomes
indifferent to his work unless he has been
thwarted in the carrying out of his ambition,
or for some other reason has been unable
to find his right place in life. Wherever
we see discontent, unhappiness, unrest, we
may be sure that the person exhibiting these
conditions is a round peg in a square hole, or
has not been able to realize his dreams. For
some reason his heart has been cheated of its
ideal. A thwarted ambition seems to wrench
the whole nature out of its normal orbit.</p>

<p>There is no suffering, except remorse, so
fatal as that which comes from the consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of blasted hope, stifled aspiration. To be
conscious that one possesses decided ability for
some particular calling, and to be compelled by
circumstances, year after year, to be chained
to drudgery which the heart loathes, requires
supreme courage. To feel that there is no
probability, or even possibility, of ever being
able to express that great hungry longing,
pent up in the heart, filling it almost to bursting,
to drag through the weary years trying to
be cheerful and hopeful and helpful to those
one loves and yet to feel that his devotion to
them has made the other thing impossible to
him, to suffer in silence disappointment which
makes the heart sick, is the greatest test of real
manhood or womanhood.</p>

<p>It is very easy to criticize other people who
have not risen in the world, as perhaps we
have; but they may be heroes compared with
us. We can never tell what tragedies may be
going on in their hearts, or from what tortures
of disappointed ambition and blasted hopes
they may be suffering. To be compelled to go
through life without any possibility of satisfying
the great soul hunger, of realizing the infinite
longings of the heart, is torture. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is no compensation for this except from the
sense of duty done to others who would have
suffered had we tried to realize our ambition.</p>

<p>I know a beautiful woman, of charming personality,
who has a great musical talent, a
superb voice and yet, she scarcely dares mention
the subject of music in the presence of her
husband, who flies into a passion at the mere
suggestion of her developing her wonderful
talent.</p>

<p>All of her friends think it is criminal of her
not to use her great gift but she feels forced
to smother her ambition. Her husband, although
well able to meet the expense will not
consider her taking lessons or making any effort
to improve this God-given talent. The
result is a blight is setting on this woman&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>She tries to be cheerful and to do her duty;
but those who understand her can see the slow
strangulation processes going on, which is undermining
her ambition and destroying her
health.</p>

<p>I recently heard through a piano dealer of
another woman of great musical talent who
with money bequeathed to her purchased a
beautiful, longed-for piano. Her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
made life so unbearable to her because of it
that she returned it to the makers, who, appreciating
her position, generously returned to
her the money paid them for it.</p>

<p>Is there anything more cruel than to
strangle a talent which was intended to be a
perpetual joy as well as to give us success?
Is there anything more wicked than to murder
a divine ambition, to destroy sacred aspirations;
anything more cruel than to make a
human being miserable who is intended to be
happy, to rob one of all possibility of doing
that which she was made to do? Yet there are
thousands of husbands who are doing this, and
they wonder why their wives are not always
buoyant and bubbling over with vivacity and
life, why they are not always cheerful, hopeful
and resourceful.</p>

<p>Many husbands do not mean to be selfish in
their home life, and really believe they are generous,
but their minds are so focused upon
themselves and their ambition that they can
only think of a wife in reference to themselves.
Whereas the highest love has the highest welfare
of the individual at heart, not its own.</p>

<p>Ambition often blinds one to justice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>There is nothing more pitiable than to see a
man the victim of an inordinate, selfish ambition
to advance himself at all costs, to gain
fame, or notoriety, or pleasure, no matter who
is sacrificed in the process.</p>

<p>Many women have a marvelous way of hiding
their griefs, covering up their disappointment;
but such disappointment may mar the
whole life.</p>

<p>There is something so utterly discouraging,
disheartening, in being forced to give up the
careers they long for, that the nature never
entirely rallies from the shock. Everywhere
we see these burned-out shells of individuals
who have been robbed of their normal pursuit.
They are ambitionless, restless, ineffective
weaklings, mere pygmies of their possible
selves.</p>

<p>Ella Wheeler Wilcox gives some wise advice
that the dissatisfied and unhappy man or
woman whose ambition has been thwarted may
heed to advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not waste your vitality in hating your
life; find something in it which is worth liking
and enjoying, while you keep steadily at work
to make it what you desire,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
happy over something every day, for the brain
is a thing of habit, and you cannot teach it to
be happy in a moment, if you allow it to be
miserable for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a powerful tonic in holding the conviction
that you are in the world for a purpose,
that you are here to help, that you have a part
to perform which no one else can take for you,
because every one else has his own part to fill
in the great life drama. If you do not act
your role, there will be something lacking, a
want in the production. No one ever amounts
to much until he feels this pressure&mdash;that he
was made to accomplish a certain thing in the
world, to fill a definite part. Then life seems
to take on a new meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Few of us,&#8221; says Sir John Lubbock,
&#8220;realize the wonderful privileges of living; the
blessings we inherit, the glories and beauties of
the Universe which are our own if we choose to
have it so; the extent to which we can make
ourselves what we wish to be; or the power we
possess of securing peace, of triumphing over
pain and sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>We go through life with our eyes steadily
fixed on some distant goal, straining every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nerve to reach it. We pass on our way opportunities
innumerable of helping others over
rough places, of brightening and beautifying
the commonplace life of every day. But we
see them not.</p>

<p>Man was made for growth; to realize peace,
poise, satisfaction.</p>

<p>An ambition to be a man, to stand for more
in the community, to push our horizon farther
and farther away from us, to think a little
higher each day, to think a little more of ourselves,
to have a little more faith in ourselves
and in everybody else, an ambition to be of
real use in the world is an ambition worthy of
the man God created, and cannot but bring
happiness to the individual.</p>

<p>In the white light of history, before the tribunal
of justice, we shall not be judged for
what we seem to be or have achieved, but for
what we are and by what we have tried to do.</p>

<p>In the judgment of this tribunal, from
which there is no appeal, many failures will be
approved as successes, and many successes will
be adjudged failures.</p>

<p>It will be easy to find the story of some boy
who remained on the farm and helped pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the mortgage, stifled his ambition in order that
the favorite brother might be sent to college,
and thereby scored a much greater success than
the one for whom the sacrifice was made.</p>

<p>The girl who smothered her longings for a
higher education or sacrificed the prospects of
marriage and a home of her own, in order to
take care of her aged parents, and was not
known outside of her little coterie of friends,
may have her name recorded far higher on the
honor roll than that of the sister who went to
college, or became a great author, musician,
artist or actress.</p>

<p>In imperishable characters there will be inscribed
on the success roll of honor names unfamiliar
to most of us, the names of those who
nobly performed humble parts in life; the unknown
workers for humanity, the heroic sufferers,&mdash;some
blind, some crippled or handicapped
by the loss of hands or feet, or tortured
by incurable diseases,&mdash;who, with a fortitude
equal to that of the martyrs of old, took up
life&#8217;s burdens and bravely made the most of
the powers and opportunities bestowed upon
them by the Almighty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>WHY DON&#8217;T YOU BEGIN?</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> do you expect to do the wonderful
things you have been dreaming about? Why
don&#8217;t you begin? What are you waiting for?
Why don&#8217;t you start? Are you waiting for
a &#8220;good thing&#8221; to come to you, waiting for influence,
for pull, for some one to help you?</p>

<p>Do you know that nothing is more demoralizing
to the life, weakening to the character,
than to be constantly wishing and dreaming of
the great things we are going to do without
a corresponding effort to actualize our
dreams? Wishing without a corresponding
effort to realize degenerates the mind, destroys
initiative.</p>

<p>How many people deceive themselves into
thinking that if they keep aspiring, if they
keep longing to carry out their ideals, to reach
their ambition, they will, without any other effort,
actually realize their dreams! They do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
not seem to know that there is such a thing as
aspiring too much, as forming the dreaming
habit to one&#8217;s injury.</p>

<p>Our visions are the plans of the possible life
structure; but they will end merely in plans if
we do not persistently follow them up with a
vigorous effort to make them real; just as the
architect&#8217;s plans will end in his drawings if they
are not followed up and made real by the
builder.</p>

<p>Three things we must do to make our
dreams come true. <i>Visualize our desire.</i>
<i>Concentrate on our vision.</i> <i>Work to bring it
into the actual.</i> The implements necessary
for this are inside of us, not outside. No matter
what the accidents of birth or fortune,
there is only one force by which we can fashion
our life material&mdash;mind.</p>

<p>All men who have achieved great things
have been dreamers, and what they have accomplished
has been just in proportion to the
vividness, the energy and persistency with
which they visualized their ideals; held to their
dreams and struggled to make them come true.</p>

<p>&#8220;The crying evil of the young man who enters
the business world to-day is the lack of application,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
preparation, thoroughness, with ambition
but without the willingness to struggle
to gain his desired end,&#8221; says Theodore N.

<p>It is one thing to have the ability and the desire
to do something distinctive, something individual,
but doing it is a very different thing.
There is a tremendous amount of unproductive
ability in the great failure army to-day. Why
didn&#8217;t the men who have it make something of
themselves? Many of those men could be
prosperous, successful men of standing in
their community, instead of mendicants in a
bread line. They had the opportunity to
make good. Why didn&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>It is a good thing to ask ourselves every
now and then whether we are making good;
whether we are making the most of our opportunities;
whether we are going up or down.
Oliver Wendel Holmes says it does not matter
so much where we stand as the direction in
which we are moving.</p>

<p>In what direction are you moving?</p>

<p>There are thousands of people in this country
to-day who have splendid ambitions, who
have made resolutions to carry out those ambitions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
but who are cowering victims of doubt,
which keeps them from making a start. They
are just waiting. They are unable to make a
beginning while this monster stands at the
door of their resolution. They are afraid to
burn their bridges behind them, to commit
themselves to their purpose.</p>

<p>At the very outset of your career it is a
splendid thing to make up your mind that you
are going to be a conqueror in life, that you are
going to be the king of your mental realm and
not a slave to any treacherous enemy; that you
will choose the wisest course, and, no matter
how forbidding or formidable the difficulties
in the way, that you will take the turning which
points toward the goal of your ambition, no
matter who or what may bar your onward
path. Don&#8217;t let doubt balk your efforts.
Don&#8217;t let it paralyze your beginning and make
you a pigmy so that you will not half try to
make good when you have a waiting giant in
you. Confidence, self-assurance, self-faith&mdash;these
are the great friends which will kill the
traitor doubt.</p>

<p>The fact that you have an almost uncontrollable
impulse, a great absorbing ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to do a thing which meets with the approval of
your judgment and your better self, is a notice
served upon you that you can do the thing,
and should do it at once.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of taking responsibilities.
Make up your mind that you will assume any
responsibility which comes to you along the
line of your legitimate career and that you will
bear it a little better than anybody else ever
before has. There is no greater mistake in the
world than that of postponing present responsibility
thinking that we will be better prepared
to assume it later. It is accepting these positions
as they come to us that gives us the
preparation; for we can do nothing of importance
easily, effectively, until we have done it
so many times that it becomes a habit.</p>

<p>How often we hear people make remarks
like this: &#8220;I know that I ought to do this thing
to-day, but I do not believe I will,&#8221; or &#8220;I do
not feel like it.&#8221; So they, perhaps, procrastinate,
or let the thing slide along, and do just
the opposite to what they know they ought to
do.</p>

<p>If those who are disappointed with what
they have so far accomplished, would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
make up their minds that for one month they
would force themselves to do the things they
dislike, but which they know would be for their
good, they would get a new start on the success
road, a grip on themselves and their possibilities.
Their whole work system would
feel the resultant tonic.</p>

<p>On the very resolution to do the thing which
is best for you&mdash;no matter how disagreeable,
no matter how humiliating, no matter how
much you may suffer from sensitiveness or a
feeling of unpreparedness&mdash;depends the development
of your manhood, or womanhood.</p>

<p>Why be afraid to demand great things of
yourself? Affirm your ability to do and be
and powers which you never dreamed you possessed
will leap to your assistance. &#8220;Trust
thyself. Every heart vibrates to that iron
string.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no one that can shut the door which
leads to any legitimate ambition, to a larger,
fuller life, but yourself. There are no obstacles,
no difficulties, no power on earth, nothing
but yourself that can make God&#8217;s promise
to man void: &#8220;Behold, I have set before you
an open door which no man can shut.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>We are all reservoirs of power, and what we
make of ourselves, what we achieve in life, is
not dependent on the outward things, but on
the extent to which we draw on our hidden
forces, our latent talents and resources.</p>

<p>Whatever comes to us in life we create first
in our mentality. As the building is a reality
in all its details in the architect&#8217;s mind before
a stone or brick is laid, so we create mentally
everything which later becomes a reality in our
achievement. Our heart longings, our soul
aspirations, are something more than mere
vaporings of imagination. They are prophecies,
predictions, couriers, forerunners of things
that can become realities.</p>

<p>Hold the picture, the plan of the man or
woman you long to be and that you are resolved
to be, and stick to your mental plan of
a glorious future. Do not give up in your discouraged
moments or allow any obstacle to
blur your ideals. Persist in visualizing the
ideal man you are determined to be, and always
think of yourself as you are ambitious
to become. This mental attitude will help you
to match your dream with its reality. There is
a magnetic, attractive power in such a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
purpose, in clinging to one unwavering aim.
This sort of mental attitude and effort will establish
your relation between yourself and the
thing you are seeking.</p>
